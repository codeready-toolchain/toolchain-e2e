= Dev Sandbox Development Install

This document describes how to install Dev Sandbox in a development environment.

== Prereqs

=== OpenShift Cluster
Ensure you have access to an OpenShift 4.6+ cluster with cluster admin privileges and log in using `oc login`

=== Required Tools
Install the link:required_tools.adoc[required tools].

=== Quay
. Register for a quay.io account if you don't have one
. Make sure you have set the _QUAY_NAMESPACE_ variable: +
`export QUAY_NAMESPACE=<quay-username>`
. Log in to quay.io using +
`docker login quay.io`
. Make sure that the visibility of these repositories on quay.io are all set to `public`:
 * https://quay.io/repository/<your-username>/host-operator?tab=settings
 * https://quay.io/repository/<your-username>/host-operator-bundle?tab=settings
 * https://quay.io/repository/<your-username>/host-operator-index?tab=settings
 * https://quay.io/repository/<your-username>/member-operator?tab=settings
 * https://quay.io/repository/<your-username>/member-operator-webhook?tab=settings
 * https://quay.io/repository/<your-username>/member-operator-bundle?tab=settings
 * https://quay.io/repository/<your-username>/member-operator-index?tab=settings
 * https://quay.io/repository/<your-username>/registration-service?tab=settings

=== Authentication
Configure authentication for the cluster using one of the following options:

Option #1: Contact a member of the Dev Sandbox Team for instructions on how to configure the cluster to use our internal Dev SSO. +
Option #2: Configure your own Keycloak server and set up authentication on the OpenShift cluster: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/authentication/configuring-internal-oauth.html

== Install

=== Remove Self Provisioner Role

It is strongly recommended to remove the self-provisioner role to disallow users from creating their own namespaces. This is because the Dev Sandbox is designed to create/manage namespaces for users automatically. It creates these namespaces based on predefined templates that also define resource limits so only these namespaces should be accessible to Dev Sandbox users.

Run the following commands:
```
oc patch clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -p '{"subjects": null, "metadata": {"annotations":{"rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate": "false"}}}'
oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group self-provisioner system:authenticated:oauth
```

=== Install Dev Sandbox
. Clone this repository +
`+git clone git@github.com:codeready-toolchain/toolchain-e2e.git+`
. Run the following to install the Dev Sandbox operators +
`make dev-deploy-e2e`
. Make note of the Registration Service URL that is printed at the end
. Run `oc get toolchainstatus -n <quay-io-username>-host-operator` and ensure the Ready status is `True`
+
```
NAME               MURS   READY   LAST UPDATED
toolchain-status   0      True    2021-03-24T22:39:36Z
```

. Open the Registration Service URL in a browser and sign up for an account.

. Wait for the message "Your OpenShift Developer Sandbox account is waiting for approval"

=== Approve The User

==== Manual Approval

Manual approval means each usersignup must be approved by editing the usersignup resource for a particular user.

. Run the following command to get the name of the usersignup resource: +
`oc get usersignup` +
+
The name should be a UUID eg. 66e54c45-9868-4a25-81ca-d56b600c8491

. Approve the usersignup
+
```
oc patch usersignup -p '{"spec":{"approved":true}}' --type=merge <usersignup name> -n <host operator namespace>
```

==== Automatic Approval

Automatic approval means enabling automatic approval in the Dev Sandbox configuration. Users will be automatically approved and provisioned without admin intervention.

. Enable automatic approval
+
```
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: toolchain.dev.openshift.com/v1alpha1
kind: HostOperatorConfig
metadata:
  name: config
  namespace: <host operator namespace>
spec:
  automaticApproval:
    enabled: true
EOF
```

=== Using the Sandbox

After approval the registration service will display a link to start using the Sandbox. The link will go to the user's Dev Console, but first, a login page will appear with two options.:

Option #1: _kube:admin_ +
Option #2: The authentication method configured in the <<Authentication>> step

Select option 2 and log in using the same account used from the <<Register/Login via the Registration Service>> step.

After logging in a user will have access to only the namespaces created for them.

== Cleanup
=== Remove Only Users and Their Namespaces

Run `make clean-users`

=== Remove All Sandbox-related Resources

Run `make clean-e2e-resources`
