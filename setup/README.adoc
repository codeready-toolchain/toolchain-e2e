= Dev Sandbox Setup

This document describes how to setup a Dev Sandbox environment that is similar to production and is used as part of an onboarding process for new operators.

== Prereqs

. Provision an OCP cluster on AWS with sufficient resources: 4xlarge master nodes and at least 3 2xlarge worker nodes.
+
For example, if using the openshift-install tool to install OCP on AWS you can use an install-config.yaml file that has the following configuration:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: devcluster.openshift.com
controlPlane:
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: master
  platform:
    aws:
      type: "m5.4xlarge"
  replicas: 3
compute:
- hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  platform:
    aws:
      type: "m5.2xlarge"
  replicas: 3
metadata:
  name: sandbox-test
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  machineNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
  networkType: OpenShiftSDN
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
platform:
  aws:
    region: us-east-1
publish: External

. Ensure you have the https://github.com/codeready-toolchain/toolchain-e2e#pre-installed-tools[required tools] installed

. Install your operator(s)

. Create an OpenShift template file that defines resources for testing the performance of your onboarding operator and any other resources that users typically create when using your operator. A Dev Sandbox template is provided with a default set of resources to help mimic a production environment https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeready-toolchain/toolchain-e2e/master/setup/resources/user-workloads.yaml[user-workloads.yaml] and should be used alongside the onboarding operator's template file you create in this step.
+
+ This setup tool will automatically create resources on behalf of the users in their `stage` namespaces. The resources are defined in template files and fed to the tool using the `--template` parameter.
+
Note #1: All resources will be created in the user's `-stage` namespace regardless of whether resources in the template have a namespace set.
Note #2: Only resources that a user has permissions to create will be successfully created, these are typically namespace-scoped resources limited to only the user's namespaces. If the tool fails to create any resources an error will occur. If these resources are required by the onboarding operator then this should be brought to the attention of the Dev Sandbox team.

. Complete the following steps:
* Make sure you have set the `QUAY_NAMESPACE` variable: `export QUAY_NAMESPACE=<quay-username>`
* Log in to the quay.io using `docker login quay.io`
* Make sure that the visibility of the `host-operator`, `member-operator`, `member-operator-webhook` and `registration-service` repositories on quay.io is set to `public`:
 ** https://quay.io/repository/<your-username>/host-operator?tab=settings
 ** https://quay.io/repository/<your-username>/member-operator?tab=settings
 ** https://quay.io/repository/<your-username>/member-operator-webhook?tab=settings
 ** https://quay.io/repository/<your-username>/registration-service?tab=settings
* Log in to the target OpenShift 4.6+ cluster with cluster admin privileges using `oc login`

== Dev Sandbox Setup

. Clone this repository +
`git clone git@github.com:codeready-toolchain/toolchain-e2e.git`
. Run the following to install the Dev Sandbox operators +
`make dev-deploy-e2e`
. Run `oc get toolchainstatus -n <quay-io-username>-host-operator` and ensure the Ready status is `True`
+
```
NAME               MURS   READY   LAST UPDATED
toolchain-status   0      True    2021-03-24T22:39:36Z
```
. Populate the cluster with users (by default the tool will provision 3000 users) and create resources by providing template files using the `--template` parameter.+
`go run setup/main.go --template=<path_to_onboarding_template_from_prereq_step>`
+
The provided default template (setup/resources/user-workloads.yaml) is automatically added when you run the setup. It is recommended to use the default options when running the setup tool, however default values can be adjusted if necessary. use `go run setup/main.go --help` to see the full set of options.
+
Note 1: By default 3000 users are created, of which all 3000 of them will have these resources created in their `stage` namespace. The number of users to create can be configured using the `--users` flag and the number of users with resources created can be configured via the `--active` flag. eg. `go run setup/main.go --template=<path_to_template_file> --users 4000 --active 2000` will create 4000 users and 2000 users will have resources created. +
Note 2: Separate to the resources from the template, CSV resources are automatically created. An all-namespaces scoped operator will be installed as part of the 'preparing' step. This operator will create a CSV resource in each namespace to mimic the behaviour observed in the production cluster. This operator install step can be skipped with the `--skip-csvgen` flag but should not be skipped without good reason. +
. Grab some coffee ☕️, populating the cluster with 3000 users will take approx. 2 hrs +
Note: If for some reason the provisioning users step does not complete (eg. timeout), note down how many users were created and rerun the command with the remaining number of users to be created and a different username prefix. eg. `go run setup/main.go <path to the user-workloads.yaml file> --username zorro --users 500`

=== Evaluate the Cluster and Operator(s)

With the cluster now under load, it's time to evaluate the environment.

1. Use your operators as a user would and evaluate the performance.
2. Monitor the cluster's performance using the Monitoring view in the OpenShift Console.
3. Monitor the memory usage of operators. There are many more resources created on this cluster than most operators have been tested with so it's important to look for any possible areas for concern.

== Clean up

=== Remove Only Users and Their Namespaces

Run `make clean-users`

=== Remove All Sandbox-related Resources
Run `make clean-e2e-resources`
