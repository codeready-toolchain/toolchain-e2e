= Sandbox UI E2E Tests
The e2e tests are executed against the Developer Sandbox UI running in OpenShift.

*Prerequisites*:

* Node.js (version 20)

=== Running E2E Tests

1. Ensure you have the toolchain resources deployed in your cluster (you can run `make prepare-and-deploy-e2e`)
2. Ensure you are using Node.js version 20
    - to easily manage it, you can run `nvm use 20`
3. Deploy and test the Developer Sandbox UI: `make deploy-and-test-sandbox-ui HOST_NS=<HOST_NS>`
