= Performance Testing

Before running the performance tests locally, ensure that you have one or more clusters. 
See the https://github.com/codeready-toolchain/toolchain-e2e/blob/master/multicluster_setup.adoc[multi-cluster setup] doc for instructions on how to configure multiple clusters.

== How performance is measured

All metrics collected during the performance tests come from the `/metrics` endpoint provided by the metrics server running within the operator pod.
Each controller automatically exposes its own metrics via the Operator SDK, so we don't need to add anything in our code, unless we want to expose extra data.

While the metrics evolve with time, the `/metrics` endpoint only provides "instantaneous" values so we need to poll the data from this endpoint to track changes (eg: memory or CPU) or wait until a certain value or threshold is reached (eg: number of resources processed).

A `Service` is associated with the `/metrics` endpoint on each operator pod, and the performance test creates a `Route` to expose the service. This is a requirement since the test runs outside of the cluster.

Here's an example of the metrics for the Host operator:

== What is measured

=== Processing existing resources after a new deployment

To measure how much time a controller takes to process existing resources after a new deployment, the test does the following steps:

1. Create (if needed) a route to expose the `/metrics` endpoint to the outside world.
2. Provision the user accounts.
3. Delete the host operator pod. The Deployment controller will immediately trigger a new one.
4. Wait until the `/metrics` endpoint is available again. At this point, the controller has fully bootstrapped, so the stopwatch can be started.
5. Wait until the `controller_runtime_reconcile_total(controller,usersignup-controller)` metric reaches the number of user accounts provisioned in step 1. Also, as an extra measure, wait until the `workqueue_depth(name, usersignup-controller)` metric value is `0`.
6. At this point, the controller has processed all the existing resources, so the stopwatch can be stopped, and the duration can be output in the logs.


Note:: With a limit of 10000 namespaces per member cluster and 3 namespaces per user provisioned with the `basic` tier, multiple member clusters may be needed to support more than 3k users. Here with 1000 users, a single member cluster is enough.
