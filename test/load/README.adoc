= Loading Users and Generating Activity

This package provides a CLI utility to load, deactivate and ban test users on regular intervals, in order to generate activity on the clusters.

Loads the Kube config from the following location, in order of preferences:

1. the location defined by the `KUBECONFIG` env var 
2. the location defined by the `kubeconfig` command line flag
3. `~/.kube/config`

[WARNING]
Make sure you connect to the expected cluster!
